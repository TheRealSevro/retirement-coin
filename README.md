A crypto for a public retirement account

The premise

Retirement Coin

Short overview: 

The main benefits will be that the retirement is not tied to your employer, you can leave and it will go with you. 

It’s also governed by a computer that can’t be bribed or stolen or hacked.

This retirement, although only 20 years, can be used multiple times so you can stager your staked coins so you can increase or decrease the amount of retirement you have per year with some planning.

Your retirement is not tied to your life so you can allow children to inherit it, and possibly inheritance tax.

A coin staked in a wallet- after 20 years of inactivity it locks itself and pays out to the wallet holder for 20 years then self-destructs. 

You can stake as many coins as you want as fast or as slow as you want. 

You can buy sell or trade the coins. Until they are staked- then you can sell the wallet.

A certain amount will be sold every year at a cap to not over inflate

All coins new purchased money will go into an account that will be used as a retirement investment account. New coins would be 25% more expansive every year.

Burn rate would be 5% per transaction 

This money will then pay out 47% of profits to staked coins divided down, and paid out in a stable coin.

50% of profits will be reinvested into account to keep it growing- then staked forever

5% of any trade price would also automatically be charged an put into the investment account further increasingly Intrest rates

3% of profits will go to fees and services to keep management of accounts paid. This would be a councils of some kind- im assuming the original coders and myself. Possible pick 7 random holders to help vote on some issues- they would receive a airdropped vote token that would allow them to use it to vote on any proposal put forth. It would be anonymous and random among holders.......There will have to be a system to modify or change things if a problem comes up- but I am unsure how to do it


The investment account is locked in as to never drop to a 0 value.- theoretically marking the account always able to pay out to whomever owns a staked coin

We will approach some exchanges to possibly make a deal to be paid to Add liquidity to their exchange - this would be a stable source of income and further help the crypto world at large become stable- this would only be allowed in safe exchanges

Also some crypto banks would be used to store some USDC and other stable coins for the 10% Intrest that would then be airdropped to wallets.


Coins that are staked that are paying out but pay out are not collected for 30 years will be returned to the Investment account fund - accelerating growth more.

Companies can join this program at a “matched rate” where they buy a portion for their employees or share costs of purchasing- similar to a 401k match plan. They would have a not stackable wallet for these large purchases.

The coins themselves can be used as a currency or economic boost in times of need, their value will go up forever and the ledger would be public on how much each coin will “predictably pay out” so in hard times some families could use them for a boost. 

Hypothetically: The world would be able to participate so people in poor places could stake 1 coin but people in LA would need to stake 14.5 coins per year to live etc...each person could figure out what they needed on their own. 

The account would be as divers as possible so no one economic downturn could cripple the account. As well as some $ in stable return projects that pay on crypto like the crypto bank ect.
